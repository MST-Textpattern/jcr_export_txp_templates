h1. Export page and form templates as files

This plugin adds a new pane under ‘extensions’ from which you can export pages, forms, and CSS styling to a specified templates folder for convenient editing using your preferred code editor. Use it to archive a site's templates, or as an initial export from an existing site for use with "rah_flat":https://github.com/gocom/rah_flat.


h2(#installation). Installation

Paste the .txt or .zip.txt package code into the Admin > Plugins tab, install and enable the plugin. Visit the "Extensions" tab and get ready to export.


h2(#usage). Usage

By default the plugin looks for a directory called @templates/export@ alongside the @textpattern@ directory. If the directory does not exist, the plugin will attempt to create it the first time you export your templates. If this should fail, you will need to create the directory manually and assign write permissions using @chmod 775@ (or @chmod 777@ if your host requires it) before you can proceed.

h2(#settings). Settings

Forms are named according to the naming scheme @{form-name}.{type}.txp@ by default, but if you prefer type-name notation, set the variable @form_naming_scheme@ in the plugin source code appropriately:

bc. 'form_naming_scheme' =>  'type_name'


h2(#history). History

This is an excerpted and reworked version of "mem_templates":https://github.com/MST-Textpattern/mrdale-txp-plugins-from-Bitbucket/tree/5c8099c89d26d622621071aadff019dadf190a14/mem_templates v0.2 with just the export facility. mem_templates was an adaptation of "hcg_templates":http://bertgarcia.org/txpide%3Astart#hcg_templates, which in turn was a modification of "mcw_templates":http://mikewest.org/archive/mcw-templates ("github":https://github.com/mikewest/mcw_templates/tree/master).
